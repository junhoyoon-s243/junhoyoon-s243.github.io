 Assistant Professor of Management Science and Systems <br> School of Management, <a style="font-weight:bold" href='https://management.buffalo.edu/faculty/academic-departments/management-science-systems/faculty/junho-yoon.html'>University at Buffalo</a>  [<a href='mailto:jyoon11@buffalo.edu'>email</a>]



My research leverages machine learning, network science, and econometrics to derive business intelligence for firms and policymakers. I study questions about technology innovation, interfirm collaboration, and healthcare. I earned my Ph.D. in Business Administration from the Tippie College of Business at the University of Iowa, under the guidance of Dr. [Gautam Pant](https://sites.google.com/view/gautam-pant).
