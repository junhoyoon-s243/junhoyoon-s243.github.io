 Assistant Professor <br> Department of Management Science and Systems <br> School of Management, <a style="font-weight:bold" href='#'>University at Buffalo</a>



My research leverages machine learning, network science, and econometrics to derive business intelligence for firms and policymakers. I study questions about technology innovation, interfirm collaboration, human resources, and healthcare. I earned my Ph.D. in Business Analytics from the Tippie College of Business at the University of Iowa, under the guidance of Dr. [Gautam Pant](https://sites.google.com/view/gautam-pant).

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.-->
